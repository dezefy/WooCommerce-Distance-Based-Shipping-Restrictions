# Distance-Based Shipping Restriction

The Distance-Based Shipping Restriction plugin is a WooCommerce plugin that allows you to block orders if the shipping address is too far away from your store location. The plugin uses the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between the store location and the customer's shipping address. If the distance is more than a specified maximum distance, the plugin will block the order and display a custom error message to the customer.

## Features

The Distance-Based Shipping Restriction plugin has the following features:

- **Distance-based shipping restriction**: You can specify a maximum distance from your store location, beyond which orders will be blocked. The maximum distance can be set in kilometers or miles, and the plugin will automatically convert it to meters for the Google Maps API.
- **Custom error message**: You can customize the error message that is displayed to the customer if their shipping address is too far away from your store location. The error message can include a placeholder for the actual distance, which the plugin will automatically replace with the calculated distance.
- **Google Maps API integration**: The plugin integrates with the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between your store location and the customer's shipping address. To use the plugin, you will need to obtain a Google Maps API key and enter it in the plugin settings.

## How it works

To use the Distance-Based Shipping Restriction plugin, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Install and activate the plugin in your WooCommerce store.
2. Go to the plugin settings page and enter your Google Maps API key. You can also set the maximum distance and the custom error message in the settings.
3. When a customer places an order, the plugin will use the Google Maps API to calculate the distance between your store location and the customer's shipping address.
4. If the distance is more than the specified maximum distance, the plugin will block the order and display the custom error message to the customer.
5. If the distance is within the maximum distance, the order will proceed as usual.

Overall, the Distance-Based Shipping Restriction plugin is a simple yet powerful tool for managing shipping restrictions based on distance. With this plugin, you can ensure that you only accept orders from customers who are within a certain distance from your store location, which can help you save time and money on shipping costs.
